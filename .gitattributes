# BELGI: line-ending + bytes-hash determinism
# Goals:
# - Normalize normal text to LF for cross-platform diffs.
# - Treat evidence artifacts as byte-addressed blobs: Git must NOT rewrite bytes.
#   Use -text (NOT binary) so JSON/log evidence remains diffable.

# Default: normalize text files to LF
* text=auto eol=lf

# --- Code / docs / configs (LF) ---
*.py    text eol=lf
*.md    text eol=lf
*.yml   text eol=lf
*.yaml  text eol=lf
*.toml  text eol=lf
*.ini   text eol=lf
*.txt   text eol=lf
*.ps1   text eol=lf
*.sh    text eol=lf
*.json  text eol=lf

# --- Evidence bytes (NO normalization; keep bytes stable; still diffable) ---
policy/fixtures/**          -text
policy/closure_packs/**     -text
policy/consistency_sweep.json -text
examples/fintech-os-demo/** -text

# --- True binaries (keep as binary) ---
*.png   binary
*.jpg   binary
*.jpeg  binary
*.gif   binary
*.pdf   binary
*.zip   binary
*.gz    binary
*.tar   binary
