# BELGI Research & Validation

This directory contains the theoretical framework and planned experiments for verifying BELGI's efficacy in reducing semantic drift in Large Language Models.

## Contents

- **[metrics.md](metrics.md)**: Mathematical definitions of entropy (E1-E4), divergence, and clustering used to quantify deterministic reproducibility.
- **[experiment-design.md](experiment-design.md)**: The protocol for comparative analysis between BELGI-governed workflows and baseline (ad-hoc) development.

> **Note:** These documents represent active research areas and future roadmap items for the BELGI protocol.
